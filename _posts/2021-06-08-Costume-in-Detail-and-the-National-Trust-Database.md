The wonderful Nancy Bradfield book *Costume in Detail* lacks color illustrations, but the national trust has published a few color photos of the Snowshill-Wade Costume Collection. Here are a few objects, organized by page number. The color photographs, are, unfortunately, considerably less revealing of the original articles than Bradfield's drawings. A few of Bradfield's dates are off, but that's to be expected.

The National Trust has also added bibiographic references to *Patterns of Fashion I* and *English Costume in the 19th Century*, but since I own neither of those books, I have not verified them.
