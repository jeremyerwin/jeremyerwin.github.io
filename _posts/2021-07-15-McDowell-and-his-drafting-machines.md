This is a somewhat aimless collection of notes on Albert McDowell, an inventor and publisher. I am not lucky enough to own one of his brass dressmaking machines; my interest lies mostly in his carreer as a magazine publisher. Nevertheless, here are some references i've discovered from pouring through the Library of Congress's fashion periodicals-- an activity interrupted by the epidemic. I have quite a few research angles to investigate!

One particularly useful reference on the McDowell Drafting Machines is Claudia Kidwell's *Cutting a Fashionable Fit* (1979), available free from the Smithsonian Institution.  I would recommend getting the High resolution PDF, as the low resolution version has illegible diagrams, and the mobi and epub versions contain many OCR errors.

Albert McDowell was granted several patents for his drafting machines, sometimes too late to withstand the changing fashions. The actual drafting machine does not appear to give numbers, but Kidwell lists them as follows.
 
- Mar 18 1878 [213436](https://patents.google.com/patent/US213436A)
- Jan 6 1885 [310297](https://patents.google.com/patent/US310297A/)
- May 18 1886 [342216](https://patents.google.com/patent/US342216A)

McDowell also published several books on his pattern making systems

Throughout the 1890s, he published a number of fashion periodicals, all purporting to bring news of the latest Parisian fashions

- [The French dressmaker, formerly "La Couturière," first professional fashion journal of Paris ... New York, A. McDowell & co.; Paris, L. Michau, 18  v. illus., col. plates. 40 cm.  TT500 .F84](https://lccn.loc.gov/ca06001188) (LCC permalink)

- [The Paris album of fashions \(formerly: Album des modes\) a monthly journal of new and artistic styles for ladies and dressmakers. New York, A. McDowell and co.; Paris \[etc. 18 \]  v. illus., col. plates, charts. 40 cm.  TT500 .P2](https://lccn.loc.gov/ca06001187) (LCC permalink)
    merged into *Mode de Paris* in 1896

- [Pictorial review. New York, N.Y. : The Pictorial Review Company, 1899-1939 volumes : illustrations ; 34-41 cm TT500 .P6 ](https://lccn.loc.gov/08036998) (LCC permalink)

	[Kevin Seligman](https://www.worldcat.org/title/cutting-for-all-the-sartorial-arts-related-crafts-and-the-commercial-paper-pattern-a-bibliographic-reference-guide-for-designers-technicians-and-historians/oclc/235943602&referer=brief_results) says that this began as a house organ for Albert McDowell; Pictorial Review Company became the publisher in 1903.

- [Popular fashions; the latest creations in the fashion world. New York etc. A. McDowell and co., 18 - ; Boston Popular fashions company\ n.d. v. illus., col. plates. 38-41 cm.  TT500 .P7](https://lccn.loc.gov/ca06001193) (LCC permalink)


- [La Mode de Paris; a journal of the latest fashions. New York etc. A. McDowell and co., 18  v. illus., col. plates. 38 cm.  TT500 .P7](https://lccn.loc.gov/ca06001186) (LCC permalink)

- [La Mode. New-York \[etc.\] A. McDowell and co., 18  v. illus., col. plates. 39 cm.  TT500 .M53](https://lccn.loc.gov/ca06001185) (LCC permalink)

McDowell aimed to cover the whole of the market for fashion journals-- the same basic content would be repackaged for different market segments-- so there would be an edition with just the color plates, or an edition for milliners, and so on.

![McDowell's many magazines](/images/mcDowellmags.jpg)

Throughout the early 1890s, each of the "professional" magazines would print, on the inside front cover, a "practical lesson in dressmaking" or a "Theoretical and Practical Lesson", detailing how to cut the latest styles. For instance, in November 1895, a Paquin Train skirt was published, though I am not so sure that Jeanne Paquin would approve.

I assume that many of these patterns could be used to expand upon basic patterns generated by the McDowell Drafting Machine-- some of the patterns invite subscribers to write in for a free copy of the book explaining the basic drafts. Unfortunately, I've not been able to locate this ephemera. 




Some of McDowell's patterns are featured in Albert Senter's 1959 thesis [*SELECTED WOMEN’S COSTUME PATTERNS OF THE PERIOD 1890 TO 1900*](https://d.lib.msu.edu/etd/14941) (free download), which unfortunately omits the notes on how to resize these patterns. Luckily, Senter's source is the Library of Congress-- it should be a simple matter to photograph the originals.


Right now, I don't have enough information to judge whether the "Parisian" provenance of these journals was invented to impress subscribers, or if McDowell translated material from French sources.

For example, the internet archive hosts three copies of [La Couturière](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Mme+Jenny+Dervilliers%22) (archive.org) which published the column "Leçon Théorique et Pratique". Is there a connection to *The French Dressmaker*? A visit to the library of congress may be in order, though the name change might have resulted from the parting of the ways.
